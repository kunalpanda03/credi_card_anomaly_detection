# credit_card_anomaly_detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It combines Isolation Forest and Autoencoders to identify anomalies in transaction data, improving fraud detection accuracy.


## Libraries Used

- `pandas` — data manipulation and analysis  
- `numpy` — numerical computing  
- `scikit-learn` — machine learning algorithms including Isolation Forest and evaluation metrics  
- `imbalanced-learn` — handling imbalanced datasets with SMOTE and ADASYN  
- `tensorflow` / `keras` — building and training the autoencoder neural network  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` — data visualization and plotting results
